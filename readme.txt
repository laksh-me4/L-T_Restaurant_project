Restaurant Menu Webpage
-----------------------

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project contains an HTML file (`restaurant-menuf.html`) that builds a full restaurant menu page. 
It is designed to be visually clear and easy for visitors to browse different menu items 
across categories (appetizers, mains, desserts, drinks, etc.).

File Structure:
---------------
/restaurant-menuf.html    -> Main HTML file containing all menu items and structure
/images/                  -> (Optional) Folder for menu item images (if you add them)
README.txt                -> This readme file

Features:
---------
1. Cleanly structured menu items with:
   - Dish name
   - Description
   - Ingredients list

2. Menu Sections support multiple categories (e.g., Small Plates, Mains, Desserts, Beverages).
3. Easy to update: add, edit, or remove menu items directly in the HTML file.
4. Accessible text-based layout that works with basic CSS styling or can be upgraded 
   with responsive and styled designs.
